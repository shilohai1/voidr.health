# Is It Brain Fog or Just the Internet? Exploring Cognitive Fatigue in the Digital Age

“Brain fog” used to be a fringe term. Now, it’s practically a household phrase. Whether it’s forgetting why you walked into a room, zoning out during conversations, or feeling like your brain is running on 240p while the world moves in HD — almost everyone has experienced this strange, foggy cognitive state.

It’s tempting to blame long COVID, burnout, poor sleep, or hormonal changes — and sometimes those are the culprits. But in 2025, there’s a new, ubiquitous suspect creeping into our brains: **the way we use the internet**.

This article explores the emerging science behind cognitive fog, digital distraction, and attention fatigue — and asks a difficult but necessary question:

**Is it actually brain fog, or are we just living in a world not designed for deep thinking anymore?**

## What Exactly *Is* Brain Fog?

Let’s clear the fog a bit.

“Brain fog” isn’t a clinical diagnosis. It’s an umbrella term used to describe a constellation of cognitive symptoms, including:

- Trouble focusing or paying attention  
- Forgetfulness or difficulty retaining information  
- Slow thinking or mental fatigue  
- Word-finding issues  
- A general sense of being mentally “off”

According to Harvard Health, brain fog can be a side effect of many different conditions — ranging from chronic stress, sleep deprivation, medication effects, nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune conditions, to long COVID and beyond [1].

But lately, something has changed.

Even healthy, otherwise high-functioning individuals are reporting these symptoms with increasing frequency. And researchers are beginning to take note.

## The Digital Brain Drain: Is Our Attention Under Siege?

In a 2023 study from the University of California, researchers found that **the average adult switches between digital tasks every 47 seconds** [2]. Not minutes. Seconds.

Every app ping, news notification, TikTok scroll, or chat bubble nudges your brain out of one task and into another. These constant switches — called **“attentional shifts”** — are not just harmless interruptions. They carry a cognitive cost.

According to Dr. Gloria Mark, author of *Attention Span*, it can take **over 20 minutes to return to a state of deep focus** after an interruption. Multiply that by dozens (or hundreds) of daily distractions, and the math adds up to one thing: cognitive exhaustion.

This isn’t just about productivity. It’s about how our brain functions.

## 🧠 Neurobiology of the Fog

Let’s take a peek under the hood.

The prefrontal cortex — the part of your brain responsible for planning, attention, and decision-making — works like a muscle. And like any muscle, it tires out with overuse.

When constantly bombarded with stimuli, the brain enters a hyper-vigilant state. This triggers a cascade of low-grade stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which impair the hippocampus (the brain’s memory hub) and frontal lobe circuits involved in executive function [3].

In short, the more you scroll, switch, and self-interrupt, the more likely your brain is to enter a foggy, depleted state.

Combine that with sleep deprivation, sedentary behavior, and emotional overload — all common byproducts of modern internet use — and you've got a recipe for cognitive burnout.

## 🎯 Internet Fatigue vs. Medical Causes of Brain Fog

It’s important to acknowledge that **not all brain fog is created equal**.

For example, fogginess related to hypothyroidism, perimenopause, ADHD, or post-viral syndromes like long COVID is rooted in biology and often requires medical evaluation.

But in clinical practice — and increasingly on mental health forums — doctors are hearing from patients who describe classic brain fog symptoms **without an underlying medical condition**. When labs come back normal and symptoms persist, attention often turns to lifestyle — especially digital habits.

A growing number of psychiatrists and neurologists believe we may be witnessing the cognitive toll of the digital age itself.

## 🌐 “Tech Fog” Is Real — Even If It’s Not a Diagnosis (Yet)

A 2022 study published in *Nature Human Behaviour* coined the term “techno-cognitive fatigue” to describe the impact of sustained screen use on working memory and cognitive load [4].

Researchers noted that participants who were exposed to **highly stimulating social media environments** reported more symptoms of:

- Mental exhaustion  
- Difficulty concentrating  
- Reduced cognitive flexibility  
- Emotional numbness  

Sound familiar?

The authors concluded that this fog-like state may not stem from a neurological illness, but from an **overloaded attentional system** that’s simply not designed for constant input.

---

## The TikTok-ification of Focus

Much of the conversation about attention now centers around **short-form content**. TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts — these platforms are designed for **dopamine-driven micro-bursts** of stimulation.

But here’s the kicker: research shows that this kind of content doesn’t just shape *what* we pay attention to. It reshapes **how** we pay attention.

According to a 2023 paper in *Frontiers in Psychology*, frequent users of ultra-short-form video platforms exhibit reduced working memory performance and **increased baseline distractibility** [5].

The more your brain becomes trained to seek novelty every few seconds, the harder it becomes to stay anchored to slower, more complex tasks — like reading, problem-solving, or even having a deep conversation.

## 🚨 Is It ADHD… or Just the Algorithm?

A growing number of adults are being diagnosed with ADHD — particularly women and people who were previously overlooked. This is a good thing: many people are finally getting the recognition and support they need.

But there's also concern among professionals that the **digital attention crisis** is being misinterpreted as a neurological disorder in some cases.

Dr. Ned Hallowell, a psychiatrist and ADHD expert, calls this “pseudo-ADHD” — where the symptoms mimic ADHD (distraction, poor memory, executive dysfunction), but are actually caused by **lifestyle overload** and **constant digital interruption**.

This isn’t to say ADHD isn’t real — it absolutely is. But it highlights how much our brains are affected by our environments. And in 2025, our environment is algorithmically engineered to keep us endlessly engaged, but rarely present.

## 🧰 How Do You Clear the Fog? (Without “Detoxing” From Life)

There’s a lot of hype around “dopamine detoxes” and digital fasting — some of which is based on shaky science. But there *are* evidence-based strategies that can help your brain function better in a hyper-connected world.

### 1. Practice Attention Hygiene

Think of attention like sleep. It needs routine, boundaries, and protection. Start with small shifts:

- Create “focus blocks” during the day with your phone in another room.
- Avoid multi-tasking during mentally demanding tasks.
- Use AI tools like **Voidr Health's ClinicBot** to summarize long clinical notes, reducing screen time and decision fatigue.

### 2. Rebuild Cognitive Stamina

Just like muscles, attention can be retrained. Start with short bursts of deep work (10–15 minutes), and gradually increase. Tools like **Case Wise** from Voidr Health simulate real-time clinical decision-making under pressure — a powerful way to sharpen focus for students and clinicians alike.

### 3. Listen to Cognitive Signals

If your brain feels foggy, it’s not always a sign of illness — but it *is* a signal. Are you tired? Overstimulated? Under-stimulated? Practicing “meta-awareness” — paying attention to how your attention behaves — is a cornerstone of cognitive health.

## 🧠 When to Seek Professional Help

While lifestyle factors like tech use absolutely affect cognition, it’s important not to overlook medical causes of brain fog, including:

- Anemia  
- Thyroid disorders  
- Vitamin B12 or D deficiency  
- Hormonal changes (e.g. perimenopause)  
- Post-viral syndromes (e.g. long COVID)  
- Neurodivergent conditions like ADHD or autism  
- Mental health concerns like depression and anxiety  

If brain fog persists despite lifestyle adjustments — or significantly interferes with work, relationships, or memory — a medical evaluation is warranted.

**Voidr Health’s AskVoidr** can help you explore symptom patterns, but it’s not a substitute for a clinical assessment. Use it as a starting point, not a final answer.
