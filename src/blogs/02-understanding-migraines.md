## What Is a Migraine?

A Migraine is a recurring neurological disorder which is characterized by moderate to severe headache, often targeting to just one side of the head. It can also be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and increased sensitivity to light, sound or smell, triggering the pain even further.

According to the American Migraine Foundation, Migraines are quite different from your typical tension headaches in both it’s severity and it’s complexity, often occuring in various distinct phases.

## Types of Migraines

Migraines can present itself differently for different individuals. The International Classification of Headche Disorders (ICHD-3) identifies several types:

### 1. Migraine Without Aura
- Most common type
- Throbbing or pulsating pain
- Sensitivity to light/sound
- Nausea or vomiting

### 2. Migraine With Aura
- Neurological symptoms (auras) appear before or during the headache
- Visual disturbances: flashing lights, blind spots
- Sensory symptoms: tingling, numbness

### 3. Chronic Migraine
- Occurs 15 or more days/month for at least 3 months
- Often evolves from episodes of migraines
- May include medication overuse headache

### 4. Vestibular Migraine
- Dizziness, vertigo, and balance issues dominate
- Headache may or may not be present

## The Four Phases of a Migraine Episode

Knowing the stages of a migraine can help you recognize early warning signs and respond accordingly.

| Phase       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Prodrome** | Subtle symptoms hours or days before (e.g., mood changes, neck stiffness, food cravings) |
| **Aura**     | Sensory disturbances (e.g., visual flashes, numbness) |
| **Attack**   | Actual headache phase lasting 4–72 hours |
| **Postdrome**| Fatigue, confusion, or “migraine hangover” |

Voidr Health's AskVoidr symptom analyzer helps users track prodrome and aura symptoms to better understand patterns and potential triggers over time.

## Research-Backed Ways to Manage Migraines

While there’s no cure as such for migraines, several scientifically-backed strategies can reduce their recurrence and severity.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Always consult a healthcare provider before starting or stopping any treatment.

### Pharmacologic Options
- **Preventive Medications**: Beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, CGRP inhibitors (e.g., erenumab)
- **Acute Treatments**: Triptans, NSAIDs, gepants, ditans
- **Anti-nausea meds**: Metoclopramide, prochlorperazine

### Lifestyle-Based Interventions
- **Regular exercise**: Moderate aerobic activity 3x/week has been shown to reduce migraines (*Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, 2011*)
- **Dietary adjustments**: Avoiding individual triggers (e.g., tyramine, nitrates)
- **Sleep hygiene**: Consistent schedule and environment

### Mind-Body Approaches
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Effective for chronic migraine management
- **Biofeedback and relaxation techniques**
- **Yoga and mindfulness**: May reduce stress-related attacks

## Migraines in Med School: A Hidden Burden

According to a 2024 study in *Medical Education*, over **30% of medical students** report experiencing recurrent migraines, often worsened by:
- Long hours and poor sleep
- Screen overuse
- Skipped meals or caffeine overdependence

For med students, tools like Voidr Health’s ClinicBot help minimize the triggers during clinicals by summarizing their complex clinic notes, saving mental energy and reducing cognitive overload which is a well known migraine amplifier.

## How AI Is Helping People Track & Understand Migraines

AI tools have begun to bridge the gap between the symptom awareness and effective action. Here’s how **Voidr Health** and other platforms are improving migraines:

### Symptom Pattern Recognition
**AskVoidr** uses structured prompts and natural symptom input to suggest possible causes—without diagnosing. It’s especially useful for tracking frequency and early-stage symptoms.

### Clinical Note Summarization
During migraine episodes, reading or processing dense clinical material can be practically impossible. **ClinicBot** helps summarize notes in seconds so med students or residents aren’t burdened.

### Clinical Scenario Simulation
With migraines potentially impacting performance under pressure, **Case Wise** allows med students to simulate high-stress clinical scenarios without real-world consequences and without adding physical stress.
